This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in a Firebase Firestore application where the `set()` method appears to succeed without errors but fails to write data to the database. The `firestoreBug.js` file contains the erroneous code, while `firestoreSolution.js` provides a corrected version.  The problem arises from improperly handling asynchronous operations and promise resolution.
