The issue was resolved by properly handling the promise returned by the `set()` method and ensuring data persistence was properly awaited.  The corrected code uses `.then()` to handle the successful write and includes error handling for improved robustness.  Here's the updated code:

```javascript
// firestoreSolution.js

db.collection('myCollection').doc('myDoc').set(myData).then(() => {
  console.log('Data successfully written!');
}).catch((error) => {
  console.error('Error writing document: ', error);
});
```
This ensures that the code waits for the asynchronous `set()` operation to complete before proceeding, preventing potential race conditions and data loss.
